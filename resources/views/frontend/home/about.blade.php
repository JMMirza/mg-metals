                    We officially became an authorized precious metal dealer after obtaining membership license in 2008. We are one of the few gold refiners in Hong Kong approved by CGSE. At present, only members of the CGSE can apply to become an accredited manufacturer, as the CGSE has very strict qualifications for its accredited manufacturers of the sole physical gold and silver exchange recognized in Hong Kong.
